CodeAssistant is a SPA (Single Page Application) built with a RoR (Ruby on Rails) backend for a vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript frontend. This application is designed for beginnining coders to store the coding languages they are looking to learn as well as some quick notes on syntax or concepts that they pick up on the fly during a coding session and want to store somewhere.
